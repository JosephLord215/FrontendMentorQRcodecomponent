### What I learned

I learned how to create a card only using HTML and CSS. Also, I learned how to use media queries to resize that card.

### Useful resources

- [ W3schools | Cards ](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_cards.asp) - This helped me for understand how to create a card with just html and css.
- [W3schools | Media Queries](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_mediaqueries.asp) - This is what I used to review media queries.
